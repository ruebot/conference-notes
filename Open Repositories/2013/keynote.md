Opportunities

* culture change regarding digital scholarly objects
* federal directives regarding open data
* tool devleopment facilitating shareable objects

Challenges

* defining "digital scholarly objects"
* providing appropriate sharing modalities
* intellectual property law
* partnerships across academic silos, and incentives to share

Open Data Crucial to Science Today

* Historical perspective - Boyle + Royal Society
* Transparency, knowledge transfer -> goal to perfect the scholarly record
* Technology has significantly changed the nature of experimentation
* Computation is central to scientific research

Computation science credibility crisis

* 9% of authors studies made data available
* Generally, data and code not made avaiable at the time of publications
* Insufficient information in the publication for verification
* Replication of results difficult

"The idea is: An article about computational science in scientific publication is *not* the scholarship itself, it is merely *advertising* of the scholarship of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete ... set of instructions [and data]."

Updating the scientific method

* Branch 1
  * deductive (math, formal logic)
* Branch 2
  * empirical (statistical analysis of controlled experiments)
* Branch 3,4?
  * computational
* the central motivation for the scientific method is to root out error!
* computational science as practiced today does not generate reliable knowledge
  * need standards similar to branch 1 & 2 of the scientific method
  * "Demos of the results" -> do we really know of error has been rooted out?

Openness in science

* policy must support scientific ends -> reliability and accuracy of the scientific record
* facilitate reproducability
  * the ability to regenerate published results
  * data and code available alongside results
* the infrastructure needs to support:
  * deposit/curation of versioned data/code
  * link to published article
  * permanence of link

Policy

* "Open data" is not well-defined
* Scope - share data and code that permit others in the field to replicated published results
* Corollary - maximizes data reuse
* public access - "with many eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"

Research varies widely

* different research questions call for different tools, solutions and implementations
* questions can be solely data driven research to empirical research contained entirely in software (simulations)
* some stuff on NSF mandate + White House executive order on data openness for federal agencies

Copyright

* If people say the original meaning of the US copyright law (to promote science) enough, will it revert to that?
* Candyman! Candyman! Candyman!
* release media components (text,figures) under CC BY
* Release code components under Modified BSD or similar
* Release data to public domain or attach attribution license
* **REMOVE COPYRIGHT'S BARRIER TO REPRODUCIBLE RESERACH**

Barries to journal policy making

* standards for code and data sharing
* metadata, archiving, re-use, documentation, sharing platforms, citation standards
* review -> who checks replication pre-publication?
* burdens on authors, especially less technical authors
* evolving early research -> affects decisions on when to publish
* business concerns -> attracting the best papers
