Mark Leggot and Tom Cramer will be performing FEATS OF STRENGTH after their two sessions.

Solution bundles
  
* Avalon & HydraDAM for Media (Klein's cool stuff)
* Sufia (IR for Neckbeards)
* UCSD DAMS (DECLAN'S DAMS)
* BPL Digital Commonwealth (Statewide repository)
* Digital Image Library (Northwestern)

Current state of Hydra

* Doubled in size thrice
* Achieved all its original Goals
* Entering a new phase

Critical priorities

* Technical framework continue to advance to enable easy code sharing and reuse
* Community framework evolves to accommodate growth in:
  * Number of partners
  * Geographic range
  * Diversity of interests and capacity
* Create a full suite of solution bundles

Strategic priorities

1. Develop solution bundles
2. Develop turnkey applications
3. Grow the Hydra ecosystem
4. Codify a scalable training gramework to fuel community growth
5. Develop a documentation framework
6. Ensure that the technical framework that allows code sharing
7. Refresh and intensify the community ties

Training! YAY BESS! (We **REALLY** need this for Islandora land)

Documentation

* PRUNE!
* Consolidate
* New partners get documentation duties - this makes perfect sense and is awesome! New folks learning will notice what is wrong and what need to be added, pruned, or consolidated

Technical framework

* Code shredding & Gemification (stripping out the functions and logic of folks' framework others like)
* Hydra Gem = stable distro
