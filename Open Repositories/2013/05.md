Abstract
---

The Academic Preservation Trust (APTrust) is a consortium started by twelve universities to create a preservation repository "Owned by the Academy" for aggregating academic and research content from a wide array of institutions. Our central architecture links evolving, reusable, open source tools and development and content communities into a rich overall preservation system for expanded preservation workflow, restoration and future added-value services. As a Replicating Node in the Digital Preservation Network (DPN), we also facilitate the depositing of materials into DPN and help negotiate added succession and dark archiving services through that Federation. Building on a fundamental architecture for preservation, APTrust strives for openness and extensibility, allowing future services to be driven by community needs or developed in partnership with members.

Mission: "The Academic Preservation Trust consortium is committed to the creation and management of a preservation repository that will aggregate academic and research content..."

Same old digital preservation risk, policy, and framework talk

APTrust sits in the preservation repository layer

What?

* Focuses primarily on preservation
* Proper chain of custody
* Preserving what is sent, does not force a versioning policy
* More stuff ...
