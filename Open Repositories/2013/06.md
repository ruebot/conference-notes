Abstract
---

As cloud infrastructure continues to mature, decrease in cost, and increase in usability, repository and I.T. managers, likewise, are compelled to increase adoption. As our community continues down the path of progressively leveraging this infrastructure, certain best practices have begun to emerge. DuraSpace, an early adopter of cloud technologies, both relies on cloud infrastructure for its own internal operations as well as expands upon it in the offering of hosted services. Through the experience of deploying community resources (e.g. wiki.duraspace.org), software as a service (e.g. DuraCloud), and hosted services (e.g. DSpaceDirect) we have both discovered and embraced a set of cloud practices that guide our implementation strategies. This presentation highlights a few of these practices and relates them back to "real world" usage examples in DuraSpace infrastructure and services.
