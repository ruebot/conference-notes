Abstract
---

Archiving and delivering time-based media presents a number of special challenges for repository development and management. Workflows and storage systems must be scaled to adequately handle much larger files, metadata schema and tools must be flexible enough to describe content with complex internal structure, and multiple points of integration are needed to securely connect to streaming servers, authentication services, course management systems and other specialized services. The panelists will discuss efforts underway at their institutions to develop repository solutions for time-based media management and delivery.

Claire Stewart - Avalon

Goal: Create an open source system to enable libraries an darhcives to provide online access to video and audio collections

* Digital audio/video management and delivery system, focused on needs of libraries and archives
* Follow an agile, open source development model
* Leverage existing technologies where feasibile
* Communicate awarements

Overview

* Funded by an IMLS grant
* Original name: Variations on Video
* Partnership between Indiana University & Northwestern University

Release 1.0 Functionality

* Secure delivery of video and audio to desktop browsers and iOS devices
* Integration with a variety of authentication systems are supported along with group based authorization
* Content can be added using manual upload and description, or using batch imprt facilty (Dropbox + spreadsheet)
* Server-side transcoding
* Faceted search via Blacklight
* Support for Adobe Media Server
* [http://avalonmediasystem.org/download](http://avalonmediasystem.org/download)

Roadmap

* More robust permissions & authZ groups
* Media player improvements
* Basic monitoring and troubleshooting support
* Navigation by structural metadata
* Import of previously transcoded derivatives
* Batch updating of existing records, Migration and assignment of persistent URLs
* Logging and usage statistics

Development process

* A single, blended team
* Scrum & JIRA
* F2F for scrum training, prioritization
* Daily standups & IRC
* Pulling in sysadmins and testers as needed
* More PO time

Community

* Lessons learned in dev process
* Working with Hydra community
* Working with OpenCast matterhorn
* Integration with LMS

Challenges of Digital Media Preservation (Karen)

Challenges

* Access vs. Preservation (file size)
* New and many capture formats
* New workflows for metadata capture (descriptive & technical)

FileMaker NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

This is all pretty much the same stuff the PAISIG webinar from a month or two ago.

CAVPP (Brian)

* California Audio/Video Preservation Project
* California State Library, National Endownment for the Humanities, IMLS

AWS

* "the cloud"
* S3 & two CloudFront services
  * CloudFront CDN (http[s])
  * CloudFront Streaming (Adobe Streaming)
* Elastic transcoding service (huh! I hadn't heard of this)
* CDN

MediaElement.js (Didn't like JWPlayer)

* Set of custom Flash and Silverlight plugins that mimic HTML5 MediaElement API
* Means shiny new <video> and <audio> work
* Google Analytics plugin (track when folks hit play, pause and with a video ends)

Challenges

* Metadata and object preperation
* OAC/Callisphere requires METS
* METS "by hand" requires a certain quality
* each METS file was $10 each from vendor

UCLA Broadcase NewsScape Archive of International Television News (Todd)

What is it?

* Record ~100 national channels and ~40 international channels
* Grows at about 1TB/month
* OCR bottom half of screen
* 56 million new searchable words each month

Copyright!

* All material must be used within Title 17 USC 108 (f) (3)
* Transformativeness (UCLA)
  * Selection of sources useful in teaching and research
  * Video capture
  * Metadata updates
  * Archive search
  * Tool development
  * Social media integration
  * Tagging support

UCSD Library DAMS Streaming (Declan)

* DAMS Architecture - Declan's RDF GOD
* They're going to put Hyrdra on top of it
* AuthN & AuthZ
* Everything has an ARK
* Use encryption to protect the object stream - hashing the identifier (i think)
