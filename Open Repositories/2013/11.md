Abstract
---

This session will describe in general how Tuque was constructed to be a repository agnostic API to allow Islandora to connect to repositories using the Object Oriented approaches that programmers would expect. We will dive into the basics of Tuque, how it is laid out, and where all the major features are. We will then delve into some specific examples where Tuque has been used to implement features that would have been hard or impossible without it in the Islandora project.
