Abstract
---

Annotations are an important tool in the scholarly workflow. They can also be used in a crowdsource context to add value to digital objects. The presentation will provide an overview of annotations within the repository context, the tools and standards used, modules developed to create the Islandora Image Annotation Framework (IIAF), and will include a demonstration of sites using the framework.

Notes
---

Components:

* Open Annotation Collaboration
* Sharedcanvas
  * a distributed canvas rendered from linked data annotations and extends the OA model
  * the IIAF has simplified the data model to use only OA
  * still replies on JS
* Fedora
* Islandora
* Drupal
* Solr

Data model:

* web centric method, promoting discover and sharing of annotations
* associations between resources and annotations (body & target)
* content can be embedded within the annotation
* annotation of parts of a resource

Metadata:

* MODS used for descriptive metadata
* Customized XML form for the project
* MADS is used to describe anatomical objects
  * consider the anatomical objects 'authority' objects
  * XML forms for each type of anatomical part

Anatomy annotations:

* Each annotation is a separate fedora object
* Lots of diagrams illustrating all the object relationships

This is pretty freaking slick!
