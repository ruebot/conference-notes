Abstract
---

This session will describe how we used RSS sitemaps and RDFa microdata to improve Google indexing and search result snippets for the Fedora objects in our Islandora repository. Though we are using a custom Islandora solution, the general principles will be applicable to any site using Islandora/Fedora. We will conclude with a discussion of other search engine optimization (SEO) efforts in Islandora, such as the optimization of institutional repository (IR) sites for indexing in Google Scholar.


Notes

How?

1. Create RSS sitemaps of Fedora Objects
2. Improve search results snippets by re-using MODS metadata in <meta> tags

Sitemaps
  
* Index all Fedora objects in Solr
* Add pbulic objects in Solr to an RSS feed using Islandora
* Submit the RSS feed as a sitemap in Google Webmaster Tools

Google Scholar

* Google scholar is trickier and uses a different crawler
  * Don't have the same feedback tools as the normal crawler
* Doesn't accept RSS sitemaps
* The indexer is mean and tries to hit everything at once
* Need to tune the site so the crawler can crawl quickly - it tends to time out
* Expects meta tags in its own format
* Supports
  * Highwire Press tags
  * Eprints tags
  * PRISM tags
* Limited Dublin Core support
