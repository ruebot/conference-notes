Abstract
---

The Digital Preservation Network (DPN) was formed in 2012 to ensure that the scholarly record and output of scholarly research are preserved for future generations. DPN uses a federated approach to preservation, bringing together extant preservation systems to leverage existing expertise and infrastructure. The higher education community has already created digital repositories to provide long-term preservation and access. Replicating multiple dark copies of these collections in diverse nodes, DPN will protect against the risk of catastrophic loss due to technology, organizational or natural disasters.

This presentation will highlight: architectural Diagrams of relevant infrastructure; system Components of the DPN Nodes; data Elements in DPN; the flow of Primary Interactions in DPN; policy and operational issues.

Notes

What is DPN?

* staff and systems from already extant large-scale preservation repositories
* working with groups of experts in:
  * succession rights
  * business services

Assumptions
(Can't grab everything, lots of great info!)

* All content enters EPN by deposit into one of the DPN Nodes (First Node)
* Node with copies of this content are "replicating nodes"
* DPN Members will work directly with First Nodes to negotiate contracts and determine service levels
* Depositors, First Nodes and their designated communities will collaborate to ensure that the information contents of DPN deposits are accessible for future reuse

Initial technical partners

* APTrust (Academic Preservation Trust)
* Chrononpolis
* HathoiTrust
* Stanford Digital Repository
* University of Texas Data Repository

Architectural Overview

* Premise: Founded on proven institutions and repositories
* Components:
  * Archive/repository
  * Federated messaging (RabbitMQ)
  * Distributed registry
  * Transport (https, rsync-over-ssh, GridFTP)
  * Content packaging (BagIt -> conform to a TDB BagIt profile)
  * Encryption
* Development paradigm
  * open standards!
  * heavy on policy
  * no single solution
    * APTrust - Python
    * Chronopolis - Java
    * Stanford - Ruby
    * Texas - PHP
