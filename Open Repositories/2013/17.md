Abstract
---

One of the primary goals of the digital humanities is to systematically integrate computer systems and services into the activities of humanities scholars. There are many projects that work toward this goal, but these projects are often "one-offs" from a technology perspective: they focus on a single activity or set of activities and function independently from one another. The Islandora project, in collaboration with a number of digital humanities stakeholders, has been developing an integrated platform that combines a variety of front-end scholarly tools with a robust digital preservation back-end. This presentation will highlight the challenges and opportunities discovered along the way, and showcase both what we have accomplished and what we plan to do in the coming months.
