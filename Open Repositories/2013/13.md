Abstract
---

Despite the fact that Islandora comes with a variety of utilities that give access to the various data elements in Fedora, there is no out-of-the-box utility or service that gives one an overall picture of how these data elements are being used in the repository. This presentation discusses a custom Drupal 7 module developed at Hamilton College to generate metrics from dozens of data elements in Fedora.
