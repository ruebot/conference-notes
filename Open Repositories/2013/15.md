Abstract
---

This paper describes the prototype of a metadata extraction utility implemented in the Islandora-based repository. The paper also proposes a particular workflow that takes advantage of the extraction utility. The workflow allows for the managing of scholarly objects (e.g., journal articles and other materials) at the various stages of their lifecycle. In addition to the extraction utility, the paper recommends standards and available open source metadata management tools that are used in the workflow. The recommended existing metadata management tools allow the end users (e.g., scholars, authors) to create or fetch descriptive metadata using external services and to embed metadata into the scholarly objects. The embedded metadata then travels with the scholarly objects. When an object is submitted to the repository, metadata is automatically extracted and added to the auxiliary index and may be added to the repository metadata datastreams with the implemented utility, ensuring effective reuse of the metadata.

This is pretty insane (IN A GOOD WAY!).
