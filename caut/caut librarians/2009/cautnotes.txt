academic librarians under attack

workload talk
  * librarians and faculty doing similar work should be granted similar working conditions and compensation
  * parity between librarian workload & faculty workload
    * "tied to the desk" vs. "not tied to the desk"
  * hours of work specified (38% of caut libraries)
  * argument re: "real teaching" - poor word choice.  The argument should be framed as scholarship and research.
  * librarian language on scholarship is often diluted
  
 What to do to advance parity:
  embrace scholarship
  better balance between professional duties and scholarship
  reassignment of non-professional duties
  hire with scholarship in mind
  consider a library-based credit course
  staffing levels are a management responsibility; don't defer research due to too few staff
  strive to remove hours of work from contract

look at laurentian appointment clause for parity

<<when considering librarians, professional service or, where appropriate, library supervision shall be substituted for "teaching".>>

parity => in practice, promotion is capped at associate.
parity => strong voice, constant vigilance
