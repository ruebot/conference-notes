Laura Banfield, McMaster University

Abstract
---

Academic librarians have not been passive in the face of employer efforts to undo libraries. Librarians Laura Banfield (McMaster University) and Marc Richard (McGill University) discuss the manifestations of anti-librarian ideology at their institutions and relate the progress their associations have made in defending their work.


Notes
---

So nice to not have to give the "McMaster" talk!
