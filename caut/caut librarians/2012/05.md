Small Group Discussion - Assessing the Damage
===

Abstract
---

Participants work in small structured groups to assess the implementation of corporate managerialism in their workplaces and identify means to defend their professional practice.

Notes
---

Question - Assess how the implementation of corporate management styles has had an impact on your libraryâ€™s:

  * funding
    * yearly budget reductions
    * "tough economic times"
    * image and marketing
    * collections budgets being stretched way too far 
    * reliance on outside donors

  * terms & conditions of work
    * meritocracy
    * performance evaluations
    * cut backs on research leaves
    * continued deprofessionalization of cataloguing and reference
    * continued parity issues (library vs. faculty)
    * voices not being heard or ignored or silenced
    * management pitting library labour groups against each other
    * value of employment and work is not demonstrated (or empty words and gestures)
    * lots of re-orgs
    * NEPOTISM
    * fear of speaking out
    * loss of autonomy
    * no offices, or living in cubicle farms, or just really poor work spaces/environments

  * management practices
    * hard division between front line librarians and "management" librarians
    * increasing ratio of AULs to librarians
    * large/increasing emphasis on assessment and strategic planning
    * (from the labour side) hostility towards to phrase "collegial relations/discussions"
    * administration always playing hardball
    * folks put in acting positions for a long time 
    * non-librarians in library management positions
    * loss of ethics OR COMMON SENSE for donor gifts - "we'll do anything money!"
    * top down culture
    * management no longer cares about whether or not employees can flourish
      * professional development
      * service
      * education leaves
      * research leaves
      * we don't like your research idea, you should do this research for the library but count it as your research time.
      * loss of respect for academic freedom -- rolling back academic freedom, see AUCC statement

  * hiring & promotion policies
    * less specialized appointments -- generalization of the profession
    * devaluing and deskilling
    * restaurant analogy!
    * coordinator syndrome
    * increase in outsourcing, and reliance on "turn-key" vendor solutions
    * increase in early retirement packages then not replacing positions 
    * one example of attempts to move librarians out of the faculty association
    * not replacing/backfilling positions for sabbatical/research leaves/maternity leaves
    * attempts to systematically replace librarians with post-docs
