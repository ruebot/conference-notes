*Curation and the cloud (Lisa Snider)* 

What kind of tools and strategies can we use to preserve cloud based services and social media while still preserving authenticity? Do we have to come up with different preservation strategies and use different digital forensics tools (compared to what we use for physical media)? Additionally, what tools do we use to provide user access to electronic material, such as emails, social media, Google docs, etc.?

*New Strategies/Tools for New Technology? (Lisa Snider)*

With the popularity of new storage devices, such as SSDs, how can we preserve authenticity when our current forensics tools canâ€™t keep up with them? What kinds of strategies can we employ to preserve these kinds of materials?

*Practical digital preservation solutions for production entities (Kara Van Malssen)* 

Digital preservation solutions have primarily been developed by and for collecting institutions. Applying these within entities that are actively producing content is a challenge, and thus far has not been done consistently and/or effectively. What are digital preservation workflows for institutions with little time or resources to devote to digital preservation, with valuable assets in active use? What simple technologies could support digital preservation and be integrated into existing toolsets, such as DAMs, CMSs, or other ECM tools?
