Micro service requirements + Service oriented architecture

Discussion Topics

*Micro service requirements (Paul Wheatley)*: 

How do we design micro services to maximise their re-use and simplify their orchestration? What are our requirements for the generic aspects of their design (and most importantly their interfaces)? Can we come up with micro services that can easily be shared between orchestration systems? (See this discussion about FITS and characterisation tool wrapping http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-07-27-fits-or-not-fits)

*Service-oriented architecture for digital preservation (Mark Jordan)*:

Some work started by JISC (http://www.ahds.ac.uk/about/projects/soapi/index.htm) but current status is unknown. This topic is relevant to integrating digital preservation activities not only within an organization but also to allow cross-organization collaboration and tool-sharing. The RESTful BagIt Server (https://github.com/acdha/restful-bag-server) is an example of a such a service.


Notes

Create a set of services based on the PREMIS events vocabulary?

Identify micro service tools that made available via RESTful APIs?
