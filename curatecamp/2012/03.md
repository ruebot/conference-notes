*Requirements on file format registries (Paul Wheatley)*: 

File format initiatives are suddenly all the rage (http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-07-06-biodiversity-and-registry-ecosystem). I have previously suggested (controversial) that we haven't always clearly articulated what our requirements and use cases are for these systems (http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-07-05-dont-panic-what-we-might-need-format-registries). So what requirements do preservation tool developers (and users of their tools) have on file format registries?


Notes

Levels or characteristics of file formats should be included in registry?

  * Is the Library of Congress on good enough?
  * Argument - no. There are a bunch, but none are standardized.

Riffing on the whole Jason Scott proposal...

ONE REGISTRY TO RULE THEM ALL!
(how many times are we going to have this conversation?)

PRONOM tends to mix format facts and policies
