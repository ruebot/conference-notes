Title: Lead, follow, or get out of the way: emerging trends in the development of research collection

Presenter: Michael Moir [York]

Abstract: As holdings of academic libraries across the country become more generic through collaborative purchasing initiatives of print and electronic material, collections of rare books and archival documents make libraries unique and distinct. These research collections lie at the heart of the university's mission. They serve as building blocks for faculty and students in the pursuit and creation of knowledge, and attract media attention that heightens the university's profile in the areas of recruitment and fundraising. Collection development and acquisition policies are still rooted in the practices of previous decades, but changes are underway. This presentation will explore the implications of several factors that will influence the composition, management, and use of archival and published material, such as generational change among university stakeholders, technology, and the trend toward patron-driven acquisitions.
