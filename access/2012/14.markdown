Notes

Why books will live on the web:

1. a book i snot defined by format, but by boundednss & the intention of its creators
2. books are the most important "nodes of knowledge" that we have yet devised (pace, TED).
3. the web is the most efficient technology yet devised to allow people to share, and make use of information (especially nodes!)
4. information wants to be used (in ways creators don't imagine)
