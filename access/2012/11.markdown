Notes

Choose your question!

  * where
  * when
  * how

But! Your question might change.

Consider your source trinity -- designer + audience + data (look at the relationships)

Easy to use tools:

  * [infogr.am](infogr.am)
  * [timeline.verite.co](timeline.verite.co)
  * [overview.ap.org](overview.ap.org)
