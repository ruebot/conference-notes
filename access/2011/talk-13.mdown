Abstract
----
Marty Tarle (BiblioCommons) and Bess Sadler (Stanford University Libraries, Blacklight, Hydra) will discuss various patterns for combining software components together into larger software ecosystems.  Weâ€™ll discuss distributed development, open systems and APIs, test driven development, continuous integration, and playing nicely with other software projects.

Plugin architecture

  - clean separation between shared code and local modifications
  - clean upgrade path
  - plugin modules for new fuctionality
  - local innovation doesn't have to wait on the larger community

"When I see you working together, it's like you're all on the same team."

No code without tests

  - echo system
  - instant notification of changes
    - tweet
    - irc
    - commit log
  - everyone knows when something breaks
  - automatic documentation
    - docs are consistant, public and automatic
    - PEER PRESSURE
