  -- born digital content
    -- text
    -- audio
    -- video
    -- email
    -- web sites
    -- research data
    -- databases
    -- container files
    -- spreadsheets
    -- software
    -- ....
 -- *DIGITAL PRESERVATION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DIGITIZATION*

    -- document your decisions
    -- digital time capsule

    -- open source software toolkit that takes teh OAIS model and turns it various conceptual entities into actionable functionalities
    -- can take SIPs and turn them into AIPs (and DIPs)
    -- does it via unix pipeline design - think ubuntu's thunar file manager in combination with Bash and Python scripts
