Why is this question of collectives pressing to librarians right now?

-- continued from previous presentation - School Libraries were the the first to deal with the collective - Access Copyright
-- public libraries and academic libraries are now having access copyright thrown on to them now

-- the tariff process is completely and fundamentally different from the process of negotiating licenses - even negotiating licenses with a collective
-- we are (libraries) are now permanently in litigation with Access Copyright and other collectives - they are our permanent litigation opponents

-- it was easier for the school libraries to get involved at first because all are represented by the ministry of education - whereas each university is responsible for themselves
-- basically access copyright is going after classes of users - start with the deep and easy pockets first, school libraries, the academic, then public, then health, and so on.

Collectives have long existed in the music industry

-- 1926 Canadian Performing Rights Society
-- 1935 Copyright Appeal Board created for the above rights
-- 1940 BMI Canada
-- 1946 Composers, Authors & Publishers Association of Canada (CAPAC)
-- 

-- 1988 Copyright Act changed to allow copyright holders aggregate into collectives
-- Library consortia are specifically not allowed under the act
  -- don't have an exception under the copyright
  -- "created a cartel of buyers"
  -- basically anticompetitive

-- Access Copyright is growing under the copyright act - consortia are not growing
-- Consortia purchases of products - for example Emerald and reproduction rights are outlined in the license, then Access Copyright has nothing to sell you.
-- **Copyright Board is only involved if there is a collective**
-- Caveat - copyright collectives are now offering automatic registration
-- Access Copyright only holds specific rights - copyright holder generally only assigns a few right to Access Copyright.
  -- There are times when you have to deal with Access Copyright, original publisher, and holder for a variety of rights

-- Librarians have had experience with Cancopy (now Access Copyright) and other collectives since 1988 - but have not experienced the Copyright Board until recently
-- Why do many libraries find themselves involved with the Copyright Board now?
  -- s. 70.12 of the Copyright Act (Part VII)

-- Copyright Board of Canada is a quasi-judicial body
  -- Chairman: Mr. Justice William Vancise - Supernumerary Judge of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
  -- Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Mr. Claude Majeau - civil servant
  -- Mrs. Jacinthe Th√©berge - Quebec lawyer - communication technologies
  -- Nelson Landry - IP Litigator
  -- One vacancy
  -- **the board functions in french**

-- All the collectives really form around 3 rights
  -- Produce or Reproduce the work
  -- Perform the work in public
  -- Publish the work

-- Access Copyright's repertoire for digital rights - is it growing? (very large for print reproductions)
  -- Representing on a exclusion basis - "unless you tell us no, we are representing you."

-- Why are we having this conversation? 
  -- Risk management
  -- to avoid lawsuits
  -- BIG SCARY ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS - actual undercover representatives - ex. someone enrolled at McMaster with access to our systems, and knows the environment secretly reporting

-- Sample formula shown from previous presentation regarding the tariff

-- The interim agreement
  -- December 23, 2010
  -- ruling states that it is not mandated - institutions can elect to agree to work under the tariff
  -- extension of same payment obligations under the license
  -- extension of authorization for repographic activities under the license
  -- Inclusion of 'array of activities' introduced in the Proposed Tariff around digital content, without additional payment on an interim basis - digital content - tariff gives institutions the option to license digital copies if it so wishes
  -- extension of same reporting obligations that existed in the license
  -- extension of indemnity, as it existed in the license

-- Proposed tariff
  -- Fair Dealing statement
    -- digital works;
    -- activities around digital works;
    -- conditions required for digital work;
  -- Indemnity
    -- anti-circumvention clause
    -- increased record-keeping & reporting
    -- access to secure networks by Access Copyright for surveys
    -- Fee increase: $45/FTE
