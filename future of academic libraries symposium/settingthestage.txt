Moderater: Charles Henry [President, CLIR]

----------------------

CLIR aspires to transform the information the information landscape... (new mission statement)

What is Ithaka S+R?
	The strategic consulting and research service that focues on the transformation of scholarship and teaching in an online environment...

	Areas of research and consulting:
		* Attitudes and Practices of Faculty and Students
		* Role of the library
		* Scholary publishing
		* Sustainability
		* Teaching and learning technology

	Framing Questions:
		* What reoles do libraryusers prioritize for the library?
		* ...

	Survey is done every three years (faculty)
		* no international institutions or community colleges
		* arts & sciences fields, education, law, etc.
	---
		* Buyer role is now unparrelled in importance
		* Significantly more humanist value role now
		* Research and teaching support roles do not challenge the library's role as a buyer
		* Teaching support less valued in science areas
		* Faculty continue to grow more and more relient on network level discovery
		* Faculty 0% for undergrad information literacy teacher (huge gap between library directors ~%80)
		* Libraries highest priority strategic roles are generally relatively ow on faculty members' list of priorities for the library.
		* Spending priorities descending order [online journals, tools for discovery, staff research,...]
		* Spending priorities seem to prioritize the acquisition of new content (top priority for faculty, low for libraries' strategic priorities)
		* Spending priorities emphasize discovery (not an empahasize for faculty or libraries)

CNI - what do we know about students?
	* information skills
	* technology skills
	* mobile technology
	* attitudes and perceptions toward libraries
	* implications?

Students' seeking information
	* nearly all use scholarly databases in course-related research
	* almost all rely on the same few information resources regardless of context
	* google was "go-to" resource for nearly all students
	* students turn to course reading first and consult instructors first when seeking information

	* 83% of college students begin their information searches with search engines
	* None began with the library website; top reason is that other websites have better information

	* 80% of students rates themselves as "Very skilled" or "expert" in efficiently and effectively search the web
	* Fewer than half rates themselves as highly in understanding ethical/legal issues related to digital info
	* brands play an integral role in info-seeking activities
	* websites from .edu and .gov were trusted by students more than commercial sites
	* owership of internet capable handheld devices is increasing rapidly
	* daily use of LMS is increasing
	* the age gap in use of social media networking is decreasing

	* 45% of students say that only some or almost none of their instructors provide adequate training for the IT used in the course
	* 47% of students agreed or strongly agreed that by the time they graduate, the IT they have used in courses will have adequately prepared them for the workplace; an additional 38% were neutral
	* "Students find rsearch and writing assignments to be a serious source or stress" - NO SHIT!?

	* develop spaces that inspire

The future?
	* library of future will encourage deep connections among library staff, faculty, studetns, etc
	* will develop creative technology solution
	* develop spaces that insprire
