Presenter: Arnold Hirshon [Case Western Reserve]

Abstract: Reflecting upon an eclectic career or nearly four decades, the speaker will both explore how the worlds of art, music, and literature can serve as inspirations for leadership and move on to discuss the roles that risk, culture, strategy, ambiguity, improvisation, and opportunity play in the practice of leadership.

what is the difference between signicant and profound change?
	* significant change is brought about through effective planning and managment
	* significant change can be disruptive
	* profount change is brought about by, or that generate, deep cultural shifts

without leadership, there is no change.

the art of leadership is in the alignement of cultural perspectives (individual vs. institutional)

the ambiguity / risk cycle:
	* when institutions have vacancy in a leadership position, they tend to fill it will the opposite personality type of previous
	* risk taker before, go with conservation next time
	* ^--- is this a good thing or bad?

if we fail attempting something noble - it is not necessarily failure.

respond to what is happening, not what you think is happening

being a leader is to share the burden
