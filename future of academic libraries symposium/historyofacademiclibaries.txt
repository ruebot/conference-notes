Title: History of Academic Libraries/Part 5: The need for systemic changes across higher education libraries

Presenter: Jim Neal [Columbia]

Abstract: This paper will present a framework for thinking about the history and future development of academic libraries with a focus on the next decade, a period of "parabiosis" and systemic change. The principal drivers of this transformation will be identified, and priorities for radical collaborative action will be outlined.
