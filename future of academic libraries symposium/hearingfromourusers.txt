* no students on panel use mobile devices to access library resources
* one student has an ereader
* all studetns have posted videos on youtube
* all students have part-time jobs (more than 20hrs/week)
* nearly all students voted in last federal election

* shouldn't have to learn how to use library resources - it should be intuitive like google
* study space is biggest draw for library use, also biggest issue; need more space.
* using solcial media to communicate with students is good - but do it right. don't be square :P
	* post interesting things
	* don't bombard

* when if ever would you consider speaking to a librarian?
	* if i didn't know how to use a photocopier

* "librarians are adults"
