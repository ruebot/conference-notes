Title: Transforming library science education: Heretical thoughts

Presenter: Michael Stephens

Abstract: Just as academic libraries are evolving, so should LIS education. How do we prepare incoming students to work in radically different settings? What skills do they need? What skills are no longer necessary? We'll explore some heretical thinking and ideas about the future of library schools wiht a focus on transparency, strategic thinking and planning in trying times, creativity, innovation, and the heart.

----------

heretical thoughts!
	* if the online world is not for you, then neither may be a career in librarianship.
	* listen
	* we must end the disconnect between lis schools and the libraries in their institutions
	* coasting, in library school and in our jobs, GET OUT!

what can we do?
	* reading and learning outside our field
	* planning, implementing and evaluating spaces and centres
	* make creators
	* radical trust!
	* open communication and decision making
	* threads of technology throughout courses
	* balance
	* reflective practicioners

Yay! time for great discussion!
