Walk down the Stack
	* FedoraCommons (repository for digital assets)
		* Objects have datastreams
			* PID (persistent identifier)
			* DC (Dublin Core)
			* Asses (digital object)
			* XML (relationships, RDF)
			* XML (metadata)
			* XML (policies)
		* RDF = powerful relationship modeling
		* Semantic supoort for workflows
		* Focus on flexible content/object metadata
		* Any digital assest & any metadata schema
		* individual objects in dynamic collections
		* preservation
			* data stream versioning
			* checksum
			* audit trail
	* Drupal
		* Fedora is a resource - it must be accessed with something else
		* Modules make it flexible
			* highly customizable look and feel
			* commenting/forms
			* custom content templates and granular permissions
			* develop and maintain organic groups
			* discover, view, and manage Fedora objects
	* Islandora
		* 100% of data is stored in Fedora
		* Content Models = specialized objects
			* DC
			* RELS-EXT
			* DS-Composite-Model
			* What goes in a collection (ex. allowed mime types)
			* What happens on ingest (ex. a certain mime type is ingested, x happens)
				* System will generate your dissemation files
				* Ingest a tiff, generate lossy jpeg, lossy jp2, and lossless jp2
				* Can be a shown a form, and manditory metadata must be entered
			* What happens when an object is edited?
			* How is an object displayed
		* Collection objects
			* RELS-EXT
			* DC
			* Collection Policy
				* list of all the content models that a member of said collection may be a member of
				* relation of content models --^
		* Collection Policy datastream
			* define collection contents
			* Collection policy data streams points to relevant collection models
	* Solr
		* Islandora module for Data Discovery and Facetting	
		* Separates discovery and storage layer
		* FAST
		
	* Other technologies
		* Kakadu
		* Imagemagick
		* Abbyy
		* Tesseract
		* OpenLayers
		* Adore-djatoka


	* Solution Packs
		* Highly customizable generalized solutions for common needs
		* Organic and flexible
		* Designed for end users
		* Books, Newspapers, Video Collections, Audio Collections, Scholarly citations
