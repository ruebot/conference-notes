Title: Consortial Islandora Environments
Speaker: Paul Pound and Chet Rebman
-----

Consortial
	* Many Drupal instances accessing one Fedora instance
	* Could be many separate Drupal installs, or multisite setups
	* Segmented by Fedora Pid namespace

Examples
	* Colorado Alliance
	* UPEI Library
	* UPEI VREs
	* CAIRN (Caul Atlantic Islandora Repository Network)

Advantages
	* Each site can have own theme and layout
	* Each site can manage own users
	* Each site can have own roles and permissions
	* Each site can have a different set of modules
	* Only one Fedora instance to manage and maintain (backups, security policies, upgrades, etc)
	* Each site can have own content
	* OAI can be configured separately for each site and not all content needs to be exposed to OAI
	* Each site can have own Solr index
	* Each site has own Drupal Servlet Filter

Issues
	* Security - many Drupals hitting one Fedora instance
		* Users with same name
		* Drupal roles and permissions can grant or deny access to actions on Fedora objects
		* Drupal permission to purge
	* Limiting access to Pid namespaces helps
	* Need to use XACML at the Fedora level
	* Global or object level policies can be more granual than Drupal permissions
	* Scheduling downtown for upgrades, etc
	* Metadata standards - Formbuilder allows different ingest and metadata entry forms

Metadata schema
	* Must support *many* media types
	* Schema has to be chosen ahead of time so that fields can be defined in Solr
	* A change in Solr fields requires re-indexing
