Title: Islandoras in the Research Stream
Speaker: Dorothea Salo
-----

Data is there to be interacted with!

If you can't do things with your data, there is no point in keeping it.

Data is project based
	* double edged sword
	* fucks with sustainability
	* organization/coordination
	* fatigue

Research is all about the money
	* researcher doesn't have time for the data management
	* those at the top with all the money and IT support can care about it
	* those who don't could give fuck all
	* if you can't do it yourself, you can't do it all

Researchers tend to reject software for life
	{ but! if you build something they like... well. you know

Library responsibility, but resource starved. {coalition of the willing}

Islandora problems
	* Too much hand holding
	* Needs to push this downstream - educate librarians
		{ then we push back upstream! benefit to the entire community
	* Normal humans have to create CModels
	
Suggestions!
	* Sprouts and solution packs!
		{ bite of small problems/self contained problems
			{ CModels and metadata forms
	* Easy ways to contribute recipies back to Islandora
	* Cure Drupal and Fedora configuration difficulties
	* Step back from feature driven development
		{ focus on persona driven and task driven development
			{ the inmates are running the asylum (book - read it!)
