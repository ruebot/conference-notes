Data consultation & management

* Mandate:
  * support researchers who create data with platforms & services for the management, preservation and dissemination of their data
* Rationale:
  * Internal needs
  * External pressures
    * Lack of comprehensive national strategy
    * Changes in funder requirements
* DM Consult
  * Conduct data audits
  * Provide needs assessment surveys
  * DMP development
* Data Curation
  * Develop data curation best practices
  * Explore repository options for research data deposits
  * Develop data preservation & access plan
* Training
  * Classes
  * Workshops
  * Online guides

Pilot project: Groundwater contamination study group

  * Conducted a data audit & survey
  * Assessed the risks
  * Designed a DMP
  * Reviewed plan with research group
  * Signed agreement on shared implementation
  * Hired analyst to move & organize data

Needs assessment

* Stakeholder interviews
  * Deans, directors, department chairs
  * OMAFRA officials
 
Standards:

  * Metadata schemas
    * ddi
    * eml
    * aims
    * darwin core
    * dublin core, etc

Policies

* Reviewed external policies
  * repository requirements
  * metadata standards
  * terms of deposit agreements
* Developed project policies
* Selected trail repository platform

Recruiting data from researchers

* Bulk emails to faculty - DID NOT WORK (not surprised face)
* Went back to stakeholders to get pilot people (this worked)

Metadata development

* Requirements
  * Core elements
* Our goal:
  * To provide content for each element in DDI 2.1
* Challenges
  * Lack of readily available and document metadata records
  * Most data files received have no auxiliary data with them
  * ... slide changed :(

Highlights

* 15 studies created
* 11 studies published
* detailed metadata from
  * data files or associated papers
  * researcher websites
  * direct contact with researcher

Dataverse:

* Strengths:
  * ease of use
  * good organization of data/files
  * platform for archiving and preservation
* Weaknesses:
  * stats analysis inconsistencies
  * can only subset by numerical data; cannot subset by string data
  * unable to download metadata
