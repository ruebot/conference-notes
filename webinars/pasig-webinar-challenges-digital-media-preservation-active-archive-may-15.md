# [Challenges of Digital Media Preservation in an Active Archive](http://duraspace.org/pasig-webinar-challenges-digital-media-preservation-active-archive-may-15)

## Abstract

Preserving digital audio and video files present their own unique challenges, which become particularly difficult in an archive that is constantly in use. WGBH has been attempting to manage this problem for over 10 years. With producers currently delivering born digital files, trying to keep up with the technology keeps the archive scrambling. New workflows, file naming, organizational standards, and flexible systems to accommodate a wide range of incoming media are all needed. WGBH, with the support from NEH, is currently looking at utilizing an open source system called Hydra to help solve some of the challenges.

## Notes

"The Machine was the Format!" -- Old analogue machines

Issues

* Plug-ins to view files
* Depending on the file type, may need to re-wrap QuickTime wrapper, or fully transcode the source file
* Redultdant storage of raw and unwrapped materials
* Quality of data

Access vs. Preservation

* File size - need proxies & speed of access
* Formats - want playback consistency
* Reuse - retrieval of original & preservation files
* Searchable/findable - metadata & organization

Preservation needs

* Multiple copies
* Save original
* Fixity
* Regular storage migration
* Persistence
* File format issues
  * Migration ease
  * Future placeback

What makes video different?

* Preservation files are large
  * Uncompressed
  * Slow to move around
* Need proxy files for viewing
  * Smaller size for quick transport over network
* complicated formats
  * Not just one file type
  * Codecs, wrappers, frame speed, etc

Platform/IT issues

* Preservation is not a priority (NOT SURPRISED!)
* Interface issues
  * Access vs. Preservation
* IT relationship
  * Tech support
  * Vendor reliance
  * Need library based sustem for archivist needs rather than traditional IT company needs
* Expense
  * License cost
  * Development
  * Customizations

OpenVault

* Fedora repository only stores proxy files
* Great interface
* Great search and indexing
* Faceted searches
* No preservation files or migration process

New tools - moving forward

* Combine preservation system with access system
* Better interface
* Flexible design
* Easy to evolve
* HYRDRA!!!

Hardware/storage media

* Access
  * Online (20TB)
  * Offline
  * Nearline
* Preservation (offline)
  * Robotic tape library system
  * LT04 data tapes
  * 2 copies
  * One stored off site
* Migration needs 3-5 years
  * Both tape migration to newer formats
  * Technology migration
* New storage types & costs
  * Proprietary
  * HSM has licensing issues
