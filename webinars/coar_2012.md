# Towards repository interoperability : unleashing the true value of open access for open science

## Speaker

Eloy Rodrigues (Universidade do Minho, Portugal), a chair of COAR Working Group on Repository Interoperability.

## Abstract

Interoperability is the technical “glue” that makes possible the emerging open science infrastructure – an infrastructure that connects a global, decentralised network of repositories and other tools. While technology exists to make possible this integration, the landscape around interoperability is complex, and continually evolving.

This workshop is designed to help participants make sense of interoperability. Based on the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) briefing paper “The Case for Repository Interoperability for Open Access Repositories” and “The Current State of Open Access Repository Interoperability (2012)” we will cover interoperability standards, protocols and initiatives in connection with current and emerging services that interoperability initiatives make possible. Examples of services that will be covered include: medatata harvesting, repository networks, usage statistics, cross-system content transfer, author identification, persistent identifiers and compound digital objects.
