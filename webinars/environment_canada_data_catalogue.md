## Notes

Context: Environment Canada's Data Landscape
  
  * Ecosystem Sustainability / Science & Technology
  * Weather Environmental Services
  * Environmental Protection

EC Data Landscape

  1. Variety - range of data types and sources
  2. Volume - amount of data
  3. Velocity - speed of data creation

EC Data Management Program

  * Five interdependent, foundation projects
    * Data Governance and Architecture
    * Data Catalogue (discovery)
    * Data Portal  (access and sharing)
    * Data Consolidation
    * Data Integration & Preservation
  * Data management services in support of programs
  * Foster a data management culture

Incremental iteration!
Act Local!
Think Global!

Data Catalogue

  * Why?
    * If we cannot find our data...
      * We cannot access/use/reuse it
      * We risk collecting it more than once
      * We cannot share it
      * We cannot publish it
      * We cannot preserve it
      * We cannot share it ...
  * Project Drivers
    * Data search & discovery
    * Data inventory & preservation
    * Data publishing & sharing
      * Internal & external
      * Government of Canada Open Data, Partners, Science Departments, Federal Geospatial Platform
