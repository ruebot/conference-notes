Notes

So, apparently people do take the time to describe computing environments for digital objects

Why?

  * Emulation
  * Software registries
  * Format registries

Environments
  
  * software, hardware
  * format
  * documentation
  
Goal

  * high-leve data model for environments
  * capture the required relationship to other DP entities
  * capture desirable characteristics
  * standardized way of treating environments
  * information sharing/exchange
  * repository registries
  * backward compatiable with earlier premis
  * oais compliance
  * straightforward semantics
  * clear mapping of historic to new environment features

Requirements

  * envornments may be digital or non-digital
  * environments may be generic or instances
  * environments may be ...

Gap analysis - environment subordinate to object

  * solution too specific
  * environemnts as first class entities

Gap analysis - scope

  * primarily applicable to computing
  * no representation information in the broader sense

WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAT?

The first use blew out my hearing. There are two more use cases, and everybody went over on time. YAY!

The RDF thing... 

How accurate are file format identification tools historically?

lds3.org && http://data.openplanetsfoundation.org/ref

Pretty slick!!!

SCAPE

* What is it?
  * European Commission FP7 Integrated Project
  * Plannning and managing resource-intensive digital preservation processes
* Goals
  * hardware and software platform to support scalabvle preser vation in terms of comutation and storage
  * a data centre service providing a scalable execution and storage backend for different object management systems
* Underlying technologies
  * Hadoop stack
  * Virtualization and packaging model for dynamic deployments of tools and environments (debian packages)
  * Repository integration and services
  * workflow modeling, translation, and provising

Looks like it uses Fedora
