Notes
---

* ANDREW "ACTION" JACKSON and THE FORMATS OVER TIME
  * Where is the evidence for obsolence?
  * The experiment
    * corpus of documents over 5 years
    * UK web domain dataset (1994-2010)
      * 2.5 billion resources
      * 400,000 arc/warc files
      * 35TB
    * execution at scale
      * stored on hdfs
      * map reduce
    * DROID & Apache Tika
    * comparision and combination requires a common model
      * map PRONOM IDs to extended MIME Types
      * allows easy comparision at sub-type level
      * can cover other properties
    * CC0 - http://data.webarchive.org.uk/opendata/ukwa.ds.2/fmt
    * source - http://github.com/openplanets/nanite
    * Gaps
      * 37 formats spotted by DROID-B but not Tika
      * 129 Formats spotted by Tika, but not DROID-B
    * Conflicts
      * failed mime type mappings
      * soft signatures - pict matching 3 million jpgs
      * droid strictness - 9 million gifs, 4 million jpgs
    * both tools are horrible wiht non-html/xml text formats
    * lots of graphs showing formats use over time
    * html is _the_ dominant format
  * Results
    * over 2100 distinct hardware identifiers
  * Conclusions
    * format obsolence is complex
      * network effects do appear to stabilze formats
      * once popular formats are fading
      * more sophisticated approach needed
    * this approach only gives creator information
    * a different approach will be needed to understand resource consumption

* Cataloguing to digital curation
  * Perspective of LIBER on addressing digital curation/preservation in European libraries
  * Surveys!

* THE ARCHIVEMATICA ROAD SHOW!!!
  * How fast will Peter talk and freak out all the non-English speakers?
    * YES!
