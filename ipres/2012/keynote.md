The UNESCO Guidelines and 'Meta' Documents

* 2003 UNESCO adopted charter on Digital Preservation of Digital Heritage
* Guidelines dealt with the nature of responsibility for dealing with digital preservation
* Comparing UNESCO Guidelines principles to the National Library of New Zealand aproach
* They use three different fixity keys for authenticity
* Hrm... listed a whole bunch of documets (PREMIS, TRAC, DRAMBORA) and says they are great and high level, but they don't help us do digital preservation any more; we need an upgrade
* Sounds like he is getting that a lot of work and change may have happened in the last 10 years, but we really haven't come that far because we still have a lot of the same problems and requests
